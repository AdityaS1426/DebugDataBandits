## Summary

The purpose of our project is to utilize Events, Inheritance, & Databases in order to create a “city infrastructure”. This “city infrastructure” will include essential elements that individuals in a city would encounter on a daily basis, such as using a bank’s services, utilizing a calendar/scheduler to plan the day, implementing an attendance/grading system in a school, visiting a car dealership, etc. Our end goal is to have the user of our overall program be able to access these various utilities that entail the city so they can simulate the typical life in a city.
