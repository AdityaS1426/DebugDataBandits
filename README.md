Project: City Simulation

Group Members: Atharva Kudrimoti, Jacob Rozenkrants, Aditya Surapaneni, Arnav Swami

Project Plan Table

Brainstorm of Project Ideas

The HIGHLIGHTED ideas to the right are our top picks for programs we would like to implement in our overall project.
Online Banking System
Grocery Store Product Inventory
Hotel Reservation System
Event Scheduler/Calendar
E-Commerce Website
Digital Library
School Attendance & Grading System
Storing/Retrieving Medical Records
Car Dealership

Summary
The purpose of our project is to utilize Events, Inheritance, & Databases in order to create a “city infrastructure”. This “city infrastructure” will include essential elements that individuals in a city would encounter on a daily basis, such as using a bank’s services, utilizing a calendar/scheduler to plan the day, implementing an attendance/grading system in a school, visiting a car dealership, etc. Our end goal is to have the user of our overall program be able to access these various utilities that entail the city so they can simulate the typical life in a city.
Plan of Attack/Strategy
To be more efficient, our scrum team will split into groups of two.
Each group of two will work on a different element of the city at the same time.
This strategy ensures collaboration & participation from each individual.
Each group will communicate with each other to share ideas, help with code, resolve problems, etc.

Big Idea Requirements/Teacher Requirements
AP Units
Primitive Types will be used all throughout our project, especially in storing data, such as “int” for money in the bank or “String” for vehicle brand in the car dealership.
Using Objects is a primary part of Java; in our project, we will use objects a lot, from the cars in our dealership, the events in our calendar, the students in the school, etc.
Boolean Expressions will be used in our attendance system, while Control Statements will be used throughout our project to declare specific actions to various objects.
Iteration will be used in our bank to check over passwords, in our school to calculate percentages, etc.
Writing Classes is also a main component of our project, as we will need classes to create the functions & properties of each object.
Arrays are crucial for the database portion of our project, as we will need to input data, process the data, and retrieve the data, all of which is made easy using arrays.
Array Lists will be useful in our code if it’s necessary to resize our tables of data to include additional categories.
2D Arrays will easily allow us to store data in columns & rows, which is crucial for organization in our city’s elements.
Inheritance is also crucial, as it allows us to share attributes from subclasses to parent classes, which would aid in our bank for money transfers & other similar activities.
Recursion will allow us to break complicated features into more simpler ones, such as the internals of the bank or the car dealership.
Beyond AP Requirements
Databases will be used for almost everything in our city, such as storing bank information, student information for the school, vehicle information for the car dealership, and event information for the calendar. We will look into using DynamoDB for this.
Model-View-Controller can be utilized for simpler parts of our programs, such as the calculations for our bank & car dealership. We might even consider creating our entire school attendance system using MVC.
Data-Driven UIs are essentially the backbone to our city. Our city’s elements will be completely data-driven.
Filtering/Searching for Data will be used to look for vehicles at the dealership, search for students at school, etc.
